# Music School Management

This project is an experiment in creating a music school management application. It utilises Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, React, Next.js, React Hook Form, TanStack Table, middleware, authentication, internationalisation, server-side rendering, caching, REST API, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Git, and is deployed on [Vercel](https://music-school-admin.vercel.app/) (contact me for the password if you wish to try it out).

The project has been discontinued due to a transition to a new developer team, which will use a tech stack with which they are more familiar. Only the staff page has been completed, and the code is neither clean nor refactored. However, it should serve as a useful building block and provide some examples for those on a similar learning path.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
